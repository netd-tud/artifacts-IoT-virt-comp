//! This module defines the three different supported layouts of the eBPF
//! bytecode files that can be processed by the vm:
//! - only `.text` section - the VM only executes the instructions present
//!   directly in that section and cannot access `.data` or `.rodata` or call
//!   non-pc relative, non-inlined functions.
//! - using Femto-Containers header - the eBPF binary has the custom format first
//!   introduced by Femto-Containers (link
//!   here)[https://github.com/future-proof-iot/middleware2022-femtocontainers/tree/main]
//! - using a custom extended header containing function call relocations for
//!   non-inlined, non-pc-relative function calls and specifying allowed helper
//!   functions.
//! - using a raw ELF file and performing relocations before execution based
//!   on the relocation information specified in the binary.
//!
//! In order to avoid duplicating the interpreter to support all of these different
//! layouts, I introduced a new version of the interpreter which uses the
//! strategy pattern to change the behaviour of the interpreter based on the
//! binary layout that it is operating on. The two main things that need to change
//! are:
//! - accessing instructions from `.text` section. Different layouts have header
//!   sections that change the offset at which the first executable instruction is
//!   located in the loaded program buffer.
//! - handling funtion calls and load/store instruction is layout specific
