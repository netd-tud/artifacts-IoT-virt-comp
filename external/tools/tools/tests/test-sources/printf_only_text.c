// TEST_RESULT: 100
#include "helpers.h"

// This testcase checks if the printing functionality works when using the
// OnlyTextSection binary layout. In this approach, the binary that is sent to
// the device contains only the .text section. Because of this, we aren't able to
// access the constant strings that are contained in the .rodata / .rodata.str.1
// sections. A possible workaround is to explicitly declare the format strings
// as variables in the program. The reason this works is that the compiled eBPF
// instructions then load all chars of the format string onto the stack of the
// eBPF VM. This has a limitation where using too large format strings can
// cause the stack to overflow (as it only has 512 bytes).
//
// The motivation behind using this simple approach is that it requires minimal
// pre-processing before the vm can start executing (as the first instruction
// to execute will be at the beginning of the supplied .text section). The problem
// is that the binary size is slightly larger as the format strings are loaded
// onto the stack by using sequences of lddw instructions which inflate the binary.
// See the example below:

//   This the assembly that gets generated for the program below. It uses 5
//   load-double-word instructions to load the format string onto the stack.
//   One could argue that having this information in the .rodata section would
//   occupy less bytes. However in that case we need to handle relocations in
//   some way. Refer to the RawObjectFile or FemtoContainersHeader binary
//   handle relocations.
